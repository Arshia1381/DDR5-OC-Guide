# 5) ICs

1. Samsung 16Gbit B die *
Said to be the most-tightening of the released ICs so far (subject to change). Has XMPs of 1.3v, so this should be the daily-safe limit if/when higher voltage kits get released. Found on high-end kits (ie 6400cl36-36-36 1.3v) (GSKILL F5-6400U3636E16GA2-TZ5RK)

2. S.K. Hynix 16Gbit M die *
Has XMPs of 1.4v. Better than Samsung B die in terms of tightening. Found on mid-tier to high-end kits (ie 6800cl36 1.4v) (ADATA AX5U6800C3616G-DCLABK)

3. Micron 16Gbit Revision A die *
Has XMPs of 1.25v. Worse than S.K. Hynix M die in terms of tightening and frequency. Found on low-end kits (ie 5200cl38 1.25v) (ADATA AD5U5200C3816G-BLA)

More will be added soon!
